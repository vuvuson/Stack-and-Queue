# Stack and Queue

This project demonstrates the implementation of Stack and Queue data structures, commonly used in computer science and software development.

## Description
The project applies fundamental data structure concepts to manage data using LIFO (Stack) and FIFO (Queue) principles.

## Key Concepts
- Stack operations (push, pop, peek)
- Queue operations (enqueue, dequeue)
- Data flow control
- Algorithmic thinking

## Technologies Used
- Python

## Purpose
The goal of this project is to build a strong foundation in data structures that are frequently used in real-world applications and technical interviews.
